#React Shooter

##Codaisseur week 6 - RealTime web with websockets

This week was about learning to use **React** in combination with:
- FeathersJs
- WebPack
- Redux

We were set-up with a starter-kit which include the above and user authentication.
On that we created our 2 player React Shooter app.

##The app

In our app you can create a game and join a game.
Once you joined a game an image gets rendered between 0 and 7 seconds.
You need to click on that image to have an reactiontime calculated.
The actual reactiontime has a delay of 100 to 200 miliseconds.
